### Project Note (Course-Based Fork)

This repository is **forked and adapted from** the original [VINS-Fusion-ROS2 repository by zinuok](https://github.com/zinuok/VINS-Fusion-ROS2).  
It was modified as part of a course project for **EECE 5554: Robotics Sensing and Navigation** at **Northeastern University**.

My contributions include:
- Adapting the code for ROS2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04
- Evaluation using the EuRoC dataset
- Generating visualizations with RViz2

This fork is for **educational and research** purposes only.
